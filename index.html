                            <h6> Unlike SVG (scalable vector graphics), Canvas does not have a direct data structure in which the hierarchy of graphic objects is saved until rendering. This means that graphic operations can be built in the form of an unlimited
                                number of levels, without negatively affecting the performance of the entire application. Such an organization is great for applications such as raster art packages or programs with other intricate "multi-level" effects.</h6>
